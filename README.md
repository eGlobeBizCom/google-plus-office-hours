## About This Project
Did you watch one of our office hours and would like to play with our code? Or perhaps you're just looking for some extremely simple Google+ Platform code samples. Either way, you've found the right place! Herein you will find all of the code that we show you at our weekly [Google+ Platform Office Hours](https://developers.google.com/+/office-hours). 

*Disclaimer*: We create these samples for our sessions, but we're not making any effort to maintain them once they've been published. For this reason, please use them at your own risk! We've organized each code sample by date and included a README file with more information, but as time passes many of them may stop working.
