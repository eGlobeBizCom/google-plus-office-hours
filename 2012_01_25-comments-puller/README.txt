== What is this? == 

On 25 January 2012 us in the Google+ Developer Relations team hosted an on air 
hangout as part of our Google+ Platform Office Hours. During these office hours 
we live coded the Comments Puller.

This tool, written with the JavaScript client library and the Google+ REST API 
pulls the comments API every few seconds. This is useful if you're monitoring 
an activity on Google+ in real time, as is the case when we use comments to 
field questions during our hangouts on air.
